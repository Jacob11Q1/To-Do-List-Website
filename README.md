# To-Do List Website 📝

Welcome to my To-Do List Website project!  

This project was built as part of my journey learning **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It demonstrates how to create a simple, interactive, and persistent to-do list web application.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Toggle tasks between completed and active.
- **Persistent Data**: Tasks are saved locally using `localStorage`, so they remain after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the webpage
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsive layout
- **JavaScript** – Functionality and interactivity
- **LocalStorage** – Persisting tasks in the browser
